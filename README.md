## Introduction

This repository is a personal archive of my solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). The solutions are categorized by difficulty, problem type, and topic for easy navigation. Each solution includes the problem statement, explanation, and code implementation.

## Problem Categories

The problems are organized into the following categories:

### By Difficulty:
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

### By Topic:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching
- Others

## Solution Format

Each problem is organized in its own directory, named as follows:

```
<difficulty>/<problem_number>-<problem_name>/
```

### Example:

```
medium/4-median-of-two-sorted-arrays/
```

Inside each directory, you will find:

- `README.md`: Contains the problem description, example inputs and outputs, and explanation.
- `<language>_solution.ext`: Contains the solution code in the specified programming language.
